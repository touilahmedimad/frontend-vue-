    This thesis presents a project focusing on innovation in industrial water
    flow monitoring using the Internet of Things (IoT). I have developed a
    system that incorporates sophisticated microcontrollers such as ESP32 and
    Arduino Mega for flow data acquisition. The system leverages LoRa
    connectivity technology to create a network of flow meters, two of which are
    dedicated to data acquisition and the third, acting as a gateway, is
    connected to the Internet to transmit data to a dashboard. This system
    allows for precise and remote management of water flow measurements,
    including the exact location of the flow meters. This functionality promotes
    optimized use of water resources, cost reduction, and improved reactivity in
    case of problems, all in real time. Data transfer is carried out reliably
    and securely thanks to the HTTP protocol. Furthermore, the system has been
    designed to be scalable, allowing the integration of new sensors and data
    types, thus promoting continuous improvement of industrial processes.
